        Hi,
        
        I noticed that you started to try out %{app_name}, but you haven't set up any projects yet.

        You can setup a new project by visiting
        %{new_project_url}
        
        If you have any questions or need any help getting your %{app_name} account set up, feel free to respond to this email.
        
        Thanks,
        
        The %{app_name} Team
